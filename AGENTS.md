# AGENTS.md — Strict Rules for AI Agents

**Purpose**: This file contains STRICT, ENFORCEABLE rules. Unlike `AI_GUIDELINES.md` (philosophy and best practices), this file is a CONTRACT that AI agents MUST follow. Violations MUST be reported to the user.

**Sync**: This file MUST be synced to all projects. When updating, sync to `~/Documents/kuro-rules` (master copy).

---

## RULE 1: Read Rules First — MANDATORY

### Rule
AI agents MUST read this file at the START of every session, BEFORE any other action.

### Verification
```
ACTION: Read AGENTS.md (this file) first
VERIFY: Confirm to user "I have read AGENTS.md and will enforce all rules"
```

### Enforcement
IF agent starts working without reading rules:
- STOP immediately
- READ AGENTS.md
- RESTART the task with rules in context

---

## RULE 2: Mom Test Gate — MANDATORY

### Rule
Project CANNOT exceed 10% progress until Mom Test is COMPLETE. No production code allowed during Mom Test phase.

### Verification Checklist
Before ANY code implementation, VERIFY ALL of the following:

| Requirement | Verification Method |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Minimum 5 interviews | Check `mom_test_results.md` has 5+ interview entries |
| `mom_test_script.md` exists | File exists with EN/FR interview questions |
| `mom_test_results.md` exists | File exists with documented interviews |
| `decision.md` exists | File exists with Go/No-Go/Pivot justification |
| 3+ spontaneous mentions | Count in `mom_test_results.md` |
| 2+ solution seekers | Count in `mom_test_results.md` |

### Enforcement
```
IF any checklist item is FALSE:
  ACTION: STOP implementation immediately
  ACTION: SET progress to 10% maximum
  ACTION: REPORT missing deliverables to user
  ACTION: COMPLETE missing deliverables before proceeding
  DO NOT: Write production code
  DO NOT: Create architecture documents beyond brainstorming
```

### Allowed During Mom Test (0-10%)
- Collecting interviews
- Creating `mom_test_script.md`
- Documenting in `mom_test_results.md`
- Creating `decision.md`
- Brainstorming in `ideas.md` (NO production code)
- Discussing approaches with user

### Forbidden During Mom Test (0-10%)
- Writing production code
- Implementing features
- Creating architecture beyond high-level brainstorming
- Setting progress above 10%

---

## RULE 3: Progress Tracking — MANDATORY

### Rule
Every project MUST track progress in `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` with PESSIMISTIC estimates.

### Progress Calculation

| Component | Weight | When Complete |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Mom Test | 10% | All deliverables done, decision made |
| Core functionality | 40% | All features working and tested |
| Test coverage (60%+) | 20% | Coverage report shows 60%+ |
| Security hardening | 10% | All scans pass (bandit, safety, etc.) |
| CI/CD & DevOps | 10% | Pipeline configured and passing |
| Documentation | 10% | README, CHANGELOG, API docs complete |

### Verification
```
BEFORE reporting progress:
  CALCULATE: Sum of completed components
  SUBTRACT: 10-15% for optimism bias
  VERIFY: Does this match reality?
  IF doubt: Subtract another 10%
```

### Enforcement
```
IF progress > actual completion:
  ACTION: Recalculate with pessimistic estimate
  ACTION: Document what's missing
  DO NOT: Inflate progress to make user happy
```

---

## RULE 4: Session Summary — MANDATORY

### Rule
Every session MUST update `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` with BOTH English and French versions.

### Required Format
```markdown
# Session Summary — YYYY-MM-DD
**Editor**: (VS Code | Cursor | Antigravity | Windsurf)

## Francais
**Ce qui a ete fait** : (Liste)
**Initiatives donnees** : (Nouvelles idees/directions)
**Fichiers modifies** : (Liste)
**Etapes suivantes** : (Ce qu'il reste a faire)

## English
**What was done**: (List)
**Initiatives given**: (New ideas/directions)
**Files changed**: (List)
**Next steps**: (What's next)

**Tests**: X passing
**Blockers**: (If any)
**Progress**: X% (pessimistic estimate)
```

### Verification
```
AT END of session:
  CHECK: SESSION_SUMMARY.md updated?
  CHECK: Both EN and FR sections present?
  CHECK: Progress percentage included?
  IF missing: CREATE/UPDATE before ending
```

### Enforcement
```
IF session ends without summary:
  ACTION: Create summary immediately
  ACTION: Include all required sections
  DO NOT: Skip this step
```

---

## RULE 5: Testing Requirements — MANDATORY

### Rule
All code MUST have minimum 60% test coverage. No exceptions.

### Testing Pyramid
| Type | Percentage | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| Unit Tests | 70% | Test individual functions/methods |
| Integration Tests | 20% | Test component interactions |
| E2E Tests | 10% | Test complete user flows |

### Verification
```
BEFORE declaring feature complete:
  RUN: pytest --cov (or equivalent)
  CHECK: Coverage >= 60%?
  CHECK: All tests passing?
  IF fail: WRITE more tests
```

### Enforcement
```
IF coverage < 60%:
  ACTION: STOP new feature development
  ACTION: WRITE tests until 60%+ coverage
  DO NOT: Merge code without tests
```

---

## RULE 6: Security Scanning — MANDATORY

### Rule
All code MUST pass security scans before commit.

### Required Scans by Language

| Language | Commands |
|----------|----------|
| Python | `bandit -r .` AND `safety check` |
| Rust | `cargo audit` AND `cargo clippy` |
| Node.js/React | `npm audit` |

### Verification
```
BEFORE commit:
  RUN: Appropriate security scanner for language
  CHECK: All issues resolved?
  IF issues found: FIX before committing
```

### Enforcement
```
IF security scan fails:
  ACTION: STOP commit
  ACTION: FIX security issues
  ACTION: RE-RUN scan
  DO NOT: Commit with security vulnerabilities
```

---

## RULE 7: No Silent Failures — MANDATORY

### Rule
If any step fails, the agent MUST report it and retry. Never ignore failures.

### Verification
```
AFTER every tool use:
  CHECK: Did it succeed?
  IF failed:
    REPORT: Tell user what failed and why
    RETRY: Attempt the action again
    IF still failing: ASK user for help
  DO NOT: Continue as if nothing happened
```

### Enforcement
```
IF agent ignores a failure:
  THIS IS A RULE VIOLATION
  User should report: "Did you follow AGENTS.md?"
  Agent must: Acknowledge and fix the issue
```

---

## RULE 8: Critical Thinking — MANDATORY

### Rule
AI agents are CO-ENGINEERS, not typists. Push back on bad ideas.

### Required Questions Before Implementation

1. **"Does this actually help users?"**
   - If NO: Push back, suggest alternatives

2. **"Is there a simpler way?"**
   - If YES: Propose the simpler solution

3. **"What breaks?"**
   - Identify edge cases and failure modes

### Verification
```
BEFORE implementing:
  ASK: All 3 questions above
  DOCUMENT: Answers in response
  IF concerns: VOICE them to user
```

### Enforcement
```
IF agent implements without questioning:
  THIS IS A RULE VIOLATION
  Agent should: Proactively identify issues
  User can ask: "Did you apply critical thinking?"
```

---

## RULE 9: File Protection — MANDATORY

### Rule
Certain files MUST be in `.gitignore` and NEVER committed publicly.

### Protected Files
| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `mom_test_results.md` | Private interview data |
| `ideas.md` | Work-in-progress brainstorms |
| `architecture_notes.md` | Work-in-progress architecture |
| `.env` | Secrets and credentials |
| API keys, tokens | Security |

### Verification
```
BEFORE commit:
  CHECK: Are protected files in .gitignore?
  CHECK: Are any protected files being committed?
  IF protected file in commit: REMOVE from commit
```

### Enforcement
```
IF protected file is committed:
  ACTION: REMOVE from git history
  ACTION: ADD to .gitignore
  ACTION: WARN user about exposure
```

---

## RULE 10: Sync Rule — MANDATORY

### Rule
When rules are updated in ANY project, SYNC to `~/Documents/kuro-rules` (master copy).

### Verification
```
WHEN updating rules:
  CHECK: Is this update in kuro-rules?
  IF NO: COPY update to kuro-rules
  CHECK: Are other projects using old rules?
  IF YES: SYNC new rules to those projects
```

### Enforcement
```
IF rules are updated without sync:
  ACTION: SYNC to kuro-rules immediately
  ACTION: Update all affected projects
```

---

## RULE 11: Roadmap Adherence — MANDATORY

### Rule
Every project MUST have a roadmap file (PLAN.md or ROADMAP.md) and all development MUST follow it.

### Verification
```
BEFORE starting any task:
  CHECK: Does PLAN.md or ROADMAP.md exist?
  CHECK: Is the task aligned with the roadmap?
  IF NO roadmap: CREATE one before coding
  IF task NOT in roadmap: ASK user for confirmation
```

### Roadmap Requirements
- Clear build order with numbered steps
- Success criteria for each phase
- Anti-goals (what NOT to build)
- MVP scope definition

### Enforcement
```
IF no roadmap exists:
  ACTION: STOP and create PLAN.md
  ACTION: Define MVP scope, build order, success criteria
  DO NOT: Write code without a plan

IF code deviates from roadmap:
  ACTION: ASK user if roadmap should be updated
  ACTION: Document the deviation reason
  DO NOT: Silently ignore the plan
```

### Progress Alignment
- Roadmap phases should map to progress percentages
- Each completed phase updates SESSION_SUMMARY.md progress
- Roadmap changes require explicit user approval

---

## RULE 12: Roadmap Duration — MANDATORY

### Rule
Every roadmap MUST have a minimum duration of **one month** with clearly defined phases.

### Verification
```
BEFORE creating PLAN.md:
  CHECK: Does the roadmap span at least 4 weeks?
  CHECK: Are phases clearly defined with start/end dates?
  CHECK: Is there a realistic scope for each phase?
  IF duration < 1 month: EXPAND scope or EXTEND timeline
```

### Roadmap Duration Requirements
- Minimum 4 weeks of planned work
- Weekly milestones or checkpoints
- Clear deliverables for each phase
- Buffer time for unexpected issues (10-15%)

### Progress Calculation Integration
The roadmap progress contributes to overall SESSION_SUMMARY.md progress:

| Component | Weight | Calculation |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Roadmap Phase Completion | Sub-component of Core Functionality | (Completed Phases / Total Phases) × 40% |
| Phase Quality | Multiplier | 0.5x (incomplete) to 1.0x (fully tested) |

### Enforcement
```
IF roadmap duration < 1 month:
  ACTION: STOP and expand the plan
  ACTION: Add more phases or extend timeline
  DO NOT: Start coding with insufficient planning horizon
```

---

1. **Rule 1**: "I read AGENTS.md at the start of this session"
2. **Rule 2**: "Mom Test status: [COMPLETE/IN PROGRESS/NOT STARTED]"
3. **Rule 3**: "Progress: X% (calculated as: [breakdown])"
4. **Rule 4**: "SESSION_SUMMARY.md: [UPDATED/NEEDS UPDATE]"

- Code quality meets professional standards
- Security is never compromised
- Progress is accurately tracked
- Knowledge persists across sessions

When in doubt, ASK the user. Do not assume.
