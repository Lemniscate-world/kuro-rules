# AGENTS.md — Strict Rules for AI Agents

**Purpose**: This file contains STRICT, ENFORCEABLE rules. Unlike `AI_GUIDELINES.md` (philosophy and best practices), this file is a CONTRACT that AI agents MUST follow. Violations MUST be reported to the user.

**Sync**: This file MUST be synced to all projects. When updating, sync to `~/Documents/kuro-rules` (master copy).

---

## RULE 1: Read Rules First — MANDATORY

### Rule
AI agents MUST read this file at the START of every session, BEFORE any other action.

### Verification
```
ACTION: Read AGENTS.md (this file) first
VERIFY: Confirm to user "I have read AGENTS.md and will enforce all rules"
```

### Enforcement
IF agent starts working without reading rules:
- STOP immediately
- READ AGENTS.md
- RESTART the task with rules in context

---

## RULE 2: Mom Test Gate — MANDATORY

### Rule
Project CANNOT exceed 10% progress until Mom Test is COMPLETE. No production code allowed during Mom Test phase.

### Verification
```
BEFORE reporting progress:
  CALCULATE: Sum of completed components
  SUBTRACT: 10-15% for optimism bias
  VERIFY: Does this match reality?
  IF doubt: Subtract another 10%
```

### Enforcement
```
IF progress > actual completion:
  ACTION: Recalculate with pessimistic estimate
  ACTION: Document what's missing
  DO NOT: Inflate progress to make user happy
```

  IF YES: SYNC new rules to those projects
```

### Enforcement
```
IF rules are updated without sync:
  ACTION: SYNC to kuro-rules immediately
  ACTION: Update all affected projects
```

---

## RULE 12: Roadmap Adherence — MANDATORY

### Rule
Every project MUST have a roadmap file (PLAN.md or ROADMAP.md) and all development MUST follow it.

### Verification
```
BEFORE starting any task:
  CHECK: Does PLAN.md or ROADMAP.md exist?

```

---

## RULE 15: Rule Synchronization — MANDATORY

### Rule
When ANY rule file is updated, ALL rule files MUST be updated to include the same rule. Rules must be consistent across AGENTS.md, AI_GUIDELINES.md, .cursorrules, copilot-instructions.md, and GAD.md.

### Verification
```
AFTER updating any rule file:
  CHECK: Is this rule in all other rule files?
  IF NO: ADD the rule to all files
  CHECK: Is wording consistent?
  IF NO: SYNC wording across files
```

### Enforcement
```
IF rules are inconsistent across files:

  ACTION: STOP immediately
  ACTION: Create/fix demos until 2 are working
  DO NOT: Skip this requirement
```

---

## RULE 17: Deep Understanding Before Phase Transition — MANDATORY

### Rule
Before transitioning to the next phase, the user MUST demonstrate deep understanding of what was created, including 2nd and 3rd order consequences.

### Requirements
1. **Explain the mechanism**: How does it work under the hood?
2. **2nd order consequences**: What happens if this is used in production? What edge cases emerge?
3. **3rd order consequences**: What long-term effects? What dependencies form?
4. **Teach something new**: Agent must teach user at least one new concept
5. **Critical thinking prompts**: Agent must ask probing questions about the creation

### Verification Checklist
```
BEFORE phase transition:
  CHECK: Can user explain the mechanism?
  CHECK: Have 2nd/3rd order consequences been discussed?
  CHECK: Has user learned something new?
  CHECK: Have critical thinking questions been asked?
  IF NOT:
    ACTION: STOP and provide deep explanation
    ACTION: Ask probing questions
    ACTION: Teach new concepts
    DO NOT: Transition without understanding
```

### Critical Thinking Questions (Agent MUST Ask)
1. "What could break this in production that we haven't tested?"
2. "What would happen if 10x more users used this?"
3. "What assumptions are we making that might be wrong?"
4. "What would you do if this completely failed?"
5. "What did you learn that surprised you?"

### Enforcement
```
IF phase transition requested without deep understanding:
  ACTION: STOP and provide explanation
  ACTION: Ask all 5 critical thinking questions
  ACTION: Discuss 2nd and 3rd order consequences
  DO NOT: Allow superficial understanding
```

---

## RULE 18: Regression Prevention — MANDATORY

### Rule
A **regression** is a bug that appears in a previously functional feature after a code change. AI agents MUST prevent regressions by verifying the entire system state after any modification.

### Verification Checklist
```
AFTER any change (fix, feature, or refactor):
  1. RUN: Entire test suite (not just the local module)
  2. CHECK: Did previously passing tests fail?
  3. VERIFY: Mocks match production data structures exactly
  4. ENSURE: Fake timers are isolated and cleaned up
  5. CONFIRM: No "null" returns in mocks when objects/arrays are expected
```

### Enforcement
```
IF a regression is detected:
  ACTION: STOP new work
  ACTION: FIX the regression immediately
  ACTION: DOCUMENT why it happened (mock mismatch, side effect, etc.)
  DO NOT: Ignore failing tests from "unrelated" modules
```

---

## RULE 19: Strict Versioning — MANDATORY

### Rule
Every project MUST follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer) with author attribution (e.g., `v0.1.0-kuro`). Stable releases MUST be tagged at each validation milestone.

### Verification Checklist
```
AT each validation milestone (25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%):
  1. VERIFY: Code is stable and entire test suite passes
  2. GENERATE: Release tag with SemVer + Author (e.g. v0.1.0-kuro)
  3. PUSH: Tag to repository
```

### Enforcement
```
IF milestone reached without version tag:
  ACTION: STOP development
  ACTION: Create and push the version tag immediately
  DO NOT: Continue to next phase without a stable versioned release
```

---

## RULE 20: Hard Milestone Lock — CRITICAL

### Rule
STOP ALL code/system modifications if a progress milestone (Rule 14) is crossed without "VALIDATION_PASSED" in SESSION_SUMMARY.md. This is a hard lock.

### Verification Checklist
```
AT each validation milestone (25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%):
  1. CHECK: Is "VALIDATION_PASSED" explicitly stated in SESSION_SUMMARY.md for the current milestone?
  2. IF NO: Trigger Hard Milestone Lock.
```

### Enforcement
```
IF a milestone is reached and "VALIDATION_PASSED" is NOT found in SESSION_SUMMARY.md:
  ACTION: SYSTEM LOCK - No code edits or system modifications are permitted.
  ACTION: User MUST provide validation results and explicitly state "VALIDATION_PASSED" in SESSION_SUMMARY.md.
  DO NOT: Proceed with any development until the lock is released.
```

---

---

## RULE 21: Intelligence Harvester — MANDATORY

### Rule
The agent MUST perform external market intelligence research at every milestone (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%). This involves searching at least 3 distinct sources (Reddit, App Store, specialized forums, etc.) to identify user pain points, competitor weaknesses, and market gaps.

### Verification Checklist
```
AT each milestone:
  1. SEARCH: At least 3 external sources for the project domain
  2. ANALYZE: Identify 2+ major user complaints about competitors
  3. SYNTHESIZE: Document how the current project addresses these "pain points"
  4. RECORD: Add the "Intelligence Report" to the milestone validation documentation
```

### Enforcement
```
IF milestone reached without Intelligence Report:
  ACTION: STOP development
  ACTION: Conduct and document the intelligence research immediately
  DO NOT: Continue implementation until market gaps are documented
```

---

---

## RULE 22: Feature Focus Rule — MANDATORY

### Rule
Development MUST focus on only ONE specific feature for each periodic validation cycle (25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%). This focus on depth over breadth continues even after the MVP phase.

### Verification Checklist
```
AT each milestone:
  1. IDENTIFY: Which single feature is the focus of this validation cycle?
  2. VERIFY: Has this feature been implemented with maximum depth and robustness?
  3. CHECK: Are all other feature developments currently paused?
  4. CONFIRM: Is this rule being applied post-MVP?
```

### Enforcement
```
IF validation involves multiple shallow features or lacks a single focus:
  ACTION: STOP development
  ACTION: Re-focus on a single primary feature for this cycle
  ACTION: Ensure implementation depth meets standards before proceeding
  DO NOT: Sacrifice depth for breadth during validation
```

---

## RULE 23: Knowledge Capture — MANDATORY

### Rule
Every project failure or pivot MUST be documented in the central `kuro-rules/KNOWLEDGE_BASE/` to ensure cross-project intelligence and prevent repeating mistakes.

### Verification Checklist
```
AFTER a pivot or project termination:
  1. CREATE: A post-mortem document in `kuro-rules/KNOWLEDGE_BASE/`
  2. DOCUMENT: Rationale for failure/pivot and key technical or market learnings
  3. SYNC: Ensure this rule is added to all local project rule files
```

### Enforcement
```
IF a project pivots without a post-mortem:
  ACTION: STOP and document the failure in the master repository
  DO NOT: Start a new project without acknowledging previous learnings
```

---

When asking "Did you follow AGENTS.md?", the agent MUST provide:

1.  **Rule 1**: "I read AGENTS.md at the start of this session"
2.  **Rule 2**: "Mom Test status: [COMPLETE/IN PROGRESS/NOT STARTED]"
