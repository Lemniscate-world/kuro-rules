```

### Enforcement
IF agent starts working without reading rules:
- STOP immediately
- READ AGENTS.md
- RESTART the task with rules in context

---

## RULE 2: Mom Test Gate — MANDATORY

  ACTION: Ask all 5 critical thinking questions
  ACTION: Discuss 2nd and 3rd order consequences
  DO NOT: Allow superficial understanding
```

---

## RULE 18: Regression Prevention — MANDATORY

### Rule
A **regression** is a bug that appears in a previously functional feature after a code change. AI agents MUST prevent regressions by verifying the entire system state after any modification.

### Verification Checklist
```
AFTER any change (fix, feature, or refactor):
  1. RUN: Entire test suite (not just the local module)
  2. CHECK: Did previously passing tests fail?
  3. VERIFY: Mocks match production data structures exactly
  4. ENSURE: Fake timers are isolated and cleaned up
  5. CONFIRM: No "null" returns in mocks when objects/arrays are expected
```

### Enforcement
```
IF a regression is detected:
  ACTION: STOP new work
  ACTION: FIX the regression immediately
  ACTION: DOCUMENT why it happened (mock mismatch, side effect, etc.)
  DO NOT: Ignore failing tests from "unrelated" modules
```

---

## RULE 19: Strict Versioning — MANDATORY

### Rule
Every project MUST follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer) with author attribution (e.g., `v0.1.0-kuro`). Stable releases MUST be tagged at each validation milestone.

### Verification Checklist
```
AT each validation milestone (25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%):
  1. VERIFY: Code is stable and entire test suite passes
  2. GENERATE: Release tag with SemVer + Author (e.g. v0.1.0-kuro)
  3. PUSH: Tag to repository
```

### Enforcement
```
IF milestone reached without version tag:
  ACTION: STOP development
  ACTION: Create and push the version tag immediately
  DO NOT: Continue to next phase without a stable versioned release
```

---

## RULE 20: Hard Milestone Lock — CRITICAL

### Rule
STOP ALL code/system modifications if a progress milestone (Rule 14) is crossed without "VALIDATION_PASSED" in SESSION_SUMMARY.md. This is a hard lock.

### Verification Checklist
```
AT each validation milestone (25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%):
  1. CHECK: Is "VALIDATION_PASSED" explicitly stated in SESSION_SUMMARY.md for the current milestone?
  2. IF NO: Trigger Hard Milestone Lock.
```

### Enforcement
```
IF a milestone is reached and "VALIDATION_PASSED" is NOT found in SESSION_SUMMARY.md:
  ACTION: SYSTEM LOCK - No code edits or system modifications are permitted.
  ACTION: User MUST provide validation results and explicitly state "VALIDATION_PASSED" in SESSION_SUMMARY.md.
  DO NOT: Proceed with any development until the lock is released.
```

---

---

## RULE 21: Intelligence Harvester — MANDATORY

### Rule
The agent MUST perform external market intelligence research at every milestone (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%). This involves searching at least 3 distinct sources (Reddit, App Store, specialized forums, etc.) to identify user pain points, competitor weaknesses, and market gaps.

### Verification Checklist
```
AT each milestone:
  1. SEARCH: At least 3 external sources for the project domain
  2. ANALYZE: Identify 2+ major user complaints about competitors
  3. SYNTHESIZE: Document how the current project addresses these "pain points"
  4. RECORD: Add the "Intelligence Report" to the milestone validation documentation
```

IF milestone reached without Intelligence Report:
  ACTION: STOP development
  ACTION: Conduct and document the intelligence research immediately
  DO NOT: Continue implementation until market gaps are documented
```

---

---

## RULE 22: Feature Focus Rule — MANDATORY

### Rule
Development MUST focus on only ONE specific feature for each periodic validation cycle (25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%). This focus on depth over breadth continues even after the MVP phase.

### Verification Checklist
```
AT each milestone:
  1. IDENTIFY: Which single feature is the focus of this validation cycle?
  2. VERIFY: Has this feature been implemented with maximum depth and robustness?
  3. CHECK: Are all other feature developments currently paused?
  4. CONFIRM: Is this rule being applied post-MVP?
```

### Enforcement
```
IF validation involves multiple shallow features or lacks a single focus:
  ACTION: STOP development
  ACTION: Re-focus on a single primary feature for this cycle
  ACTION: Ensure implementation depth meets standards before proceeding
  DO NOT: Sacrifice depth for breadth during validation
```

---

## RULE 23: Knowledge Capture — MANDATORY

### Rule
Every project failure or pivot MUST be documented in the central `kuro-rules/KNOWLEDGE_BASE/` to ensure cross-project intelligence and prevent repeating mistakes.

### Verification Checklist
```
AFTER a pivot or project termination:
  1. CREATE: A post-mortem document in `kuro-rules/KNOWLEDGE_BASE/`
  2. DOCUMENT: Rationale for failure/pivot and key technical or market learnings
  3. SYNC: Ensure this rule is added to all local project rule files
```

### Enforcement
```
IF a project pivots without a post-mortem:
  ACTION: STOP and document the failure in the master repository
  DO NOT: Start a new project without acknowledging previous learnings
```

### Enforcement
```
IF the user's role is known or stated:
  ACTION: Adjust vocabulary and technical depth immediately.
  ACTION: Emphasize the rules most relevant to that persona.
  DO NOT: Speak to a CEO like a DevOps, or a DevOps like a CEO, unless pedagogical translation is requested.
```

When in doubt, ASK the user. Do not assume.

When in doubt, ASK the user. Do not assume.

| Testing | Tests, coverage, pytest, test infrastructure (Rule 5) |
| Needs Review | Code review required per Rule 28 |
| CEO Decision | Strategic decisions requiring CEO/Lead input |
3. **Progress Tracking**: The AI Agent MUST check Linear issue statuses when resuming sessions and report task progress.
4. **Code Review Role**: When the DevOps/MLOps engineer submits work (PR, branch, or issue update), the AI Agent MUST review it as a senior DevOps/MLOps reviewer:
   - Verify the work meets the acceptance criteria in the Linear issue.
   - Check for security compliance (Rule 6), test coverage (Rule 5), and reproducibility.
   - Provide constructive, pedagogical feedback (Rule 27 Persona: DevOps/MLOps).
5. **Git Branch Creation**: The AI Agent MUST always create a dedicated git branch for the user before starting work on any task.

### Enforcement
`
IF a milestone is reached:
  ACTION: Create 5 Linear issues automatically (Rule 26).
  ACTION: Assign all issues to the DevOps/MLOps engineer.
  ACTION: Create a git branch for the current milestone work.
  DO NOT: Skip Linear issue creation or assignment.

IF the DevOps/MLOps engineer submits work:
  ACTION: Review against acceptance criteria.
  ACTION: Check security, tests, and reproducibility.
  ACTION: Provide feedback as a senior reviewer.
  DO NOT: Accept work that does not meet the documented criteria.

## RULE 29: Mandatory Linear Integration — CRITICAL

### Rule
Every team member and every AI Agent MUST have a working connection to Linear before starting any work session. This is non-negotiable. Without Linear, no task tracking occurs, and work is invisible to the team.

### Integration Methods (by environment)

| Environment | Required Integration |
|-------------|---------------------|
| VS Code | Linear extension from VS Code Marketplace |
| Cursor | Linear extension OR MCP server (linear-mcp-server) |
| Antigravity | MCP server (linear-mcp-server) |
| Windsurf | MCP server (linear-mcp-server) |
| GitHub Codespaces | Linear GitHub integration + MCP server |
| Terminal-only | Linear CLI or MCP server |

### Requirements
1. **Session Gate**: The AI Agent MUST verify Linear connectivity at the start of every session. If unavailable, guide the user through setup before proceeding.
2. **Human Onboarding**: When a new team member joins, the FIRST task is to configure their Linear connection. No code is written until Linear is operational.
3. **Issue Visibility**: All tasks, bugs, and features MUST be trackable in Linear. Work done outside Linear is considered undocumented and violates traceability (Rule 4).

### Enforcement
`
IF Linear connection is not configured:
  ACTION: STOP all work.
  ACTION: Guide user through Linear setup for their IDE/environment.
  DO NOT: Allow any development work without Linear tracking.

IF a new team member joins:
  ACTION: First task is Linear setup and verification.
  ACTION: Assign them a test issue to confirm the connection works.
  DO NOT: Skip this onboarding step.
`

## RULE 30: Mandatory Branch Creation — CRITICAL

### Rule
NOBODY works on main directly. Before any work begins, the AI Agent MUST create or verify a dedicated git branch for the contributor. Every contributor gets their own branch, named according to a strict convention.

### Branch Naming Convention
`
[scope]/[issue-id]-[short-description]
`

| Scope | Usage | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| eat/ | New feature | eat/MLO-1-ci-cd-pipeline |
| ix/ | Bug fix | ix/MLO-3-docker-volume-error |
| infra/ | Infrastructure / DevOps | infra/milestone-0-setup |
| docs/ | Documentation only | docs/update-readme-badges |
| 
efactor/ | Code refactoring | 
efactor/modularize-training |

### Requirements
1. **Session Gate**: At the start of every session, the AI Agent MUST check the current branch. If on main, create or switch to the appropriate working branch immediately.
2. **One Branch Per Task**: Each Linear issue or task MUST have its own branch. Do not mix unrelated changes.
3. **Merge via PR Only**: Branches are merged into main exclusively through Pull Requests. Direct pushes to main are forbidden.
4. **Branch for Every Contributor**: When a new team member starts, the AI Agent MUST create their first working branch before any code is written.

### Enforcement
`
IF contributor is on main and about to write code:
  ACTION: STOP immediately.
  ACTION: Create a branch following the naming convention.
  ACTION: Switch to the new branch before any edits.
  DO NOT: Allow any code changes on main.

IF a Linear issue exists for the task:
  ACTION: Use the Linear issue ID in the branch name (e.g., feat/MLO-1-ci-cd).
  DO NOT: Create unnamed or generic branches (e.g., dev, 	est, 	emp).
`

## RULE 31: Codebase Context in Linear Issues -- MANDATORY

### Rule
Every Linear issue assigned to a team member MUST include a "Codebase Context" section that explains the relevant files, their purpose, and how they connect to the task. The goal is that a contributor who has NEVER seen the repo can understand exactly what to do.

### Requirements
1. **File Map**: List every file the contributor will need to read or modify, with a one-line explanation of what it does.
2. **Architecture Briefing**: Explain how the files relate to each other and to the project core architecture (Hub and Spokes).
3. **Key Concepts**: Define any domain-specific terms (e.g., "vanishing gradients", "causal compression") in plain language.
4. **Entry Point**: Tell the contributor where to START reading the code (which file, which function).
5. **Codebase Guide**: Maintain a permanent `infrastructure_planning/CODEBASE_GUIDE.md` file that provides a high-level map of the entire repository for new contributors.

### Enforcement
```
IF creating a Linear issue for a team member:
  ACTION: Include a "Codebase Context" section with file map, architecture briefing, and key concepts.
  ACTION: Update `infrastructure_planning/CODEBASE_GUIDE.md` if new files are added.
  DO NOT: Assume the contributor knows the codebase.
  DO NOT: Create issues that reference files without explaining them.
```

---

## RULE 32: Mandatory Team Stack -- CRITICAL

### Rule
Every team member MUST use the following standardized stack. The AI Agent MUST verify compliance at session start and guide setup if any tool is missing.

### Official Stack

| Category | Tool | Purpose | Required |
|----------|------|---------|----------|
| **Project Management** | Linear | Issue tracking, sprints, milestones, labels | YES |
| **IDE (Primary)** | Cursor | AI-assisted coding with MCP and rules support | YES (or alternative below) |
| **IDE (Alternative)** | VS Code / Antigravity / Windsurf | Coding with AI extensions | YES (one of these) |
| **Version Control** | Git + GitHub | Source control, PRs, branch protection | YES |
| **AI Integration** | MCP Server (linear-mcp-server) | Linear access from IDE | YES (Rule 29) |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions | Automated testing, security, deployment | YES (Rule 26 Task 1) |
| **Containerization** | Docker + docker-compose | Hermetic dev environments | RECOMMENDED |
| **Experiment Tracking** | MLflow or W&B | ML experiment logging | RECOMMENDED (MLOps) |
| **Data Versioning** | DVC | Large file versioning | RECOMMENDED (MLOps) |
| **Language** | Python 3.10+ | Core development language | YES |
| **ML Framework** | PyTorch | Deep learning framework | YES |
| **Testing** | pytest + pytest-cov | Unit tests with coverage | YES (Rule 5) |
| **Security** | bandit + safety | Static analysis and dependency audit | YES (Rule 6) |
| **Communication** | Linear comments + GitHub PRs | Async team communication | YES |

### Onboarding Checklist
When a new team member joins, the AI Agent MUST walk them through this checklist:
```
[ ] Git configured (name, email)
[ ] GitHub access to the repository
[ ] IDE installed (Cursor recommended)
[ ] Linear account created and connected (Rule 29)
[ ] MCP server configured (linear-mcp-server)

[ ] Tests passing locally (pytest tests/)
[ ] Demo running (python demo_vanishing_gradients.py)
[ ] CODEBASE_GUIDE.md read
[ ] First working branch created (Rule 30)
```

### Enforcement
```
IF a new team member joins:
  ACTION: Present the onboarding checklist above.
  ACTION: Do NOT proceed with code until all YES items are confirmed.
  DO NOT: Allow coding without Linear + IDE + Git configured.

IF a session starts:
  ACTION: Verify the contributor has the required stack.
  ACTION: If missing, guide setup before any work.
```
